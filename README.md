# CurveSmoothing
<h3>from scipy.interp import make_interp_spline</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Curve smoothing is a techique of reducing the noise in the data repersentation.</li>
  <li>Curve smoothing uses interpolation technique: <b>estimating a value between two known values by using mathematical techniques.</b></li>
  <li>In this curve smoothing we use <b>make_interp_spline</b> from scipy library.</li>
  <li>The interpolation method create a function with the data points (x,y).</li>
  <li>Make sure that the data <b>absicca 'x' </b>do not have any duplicates and is in increasing order.</li>
  <li>The data <b>Ordinate 'y' </b>may have any duplicates.</li>
  <li>Curve smoothing can be done many ways such as <b>by mean, by exponential</b> etc..</li>
</ul>
