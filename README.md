# CurveSmoothing
<h3>from scipy.interp import make_interp_spline</h3>
<p>Curve smoothing is a techique of reducing the noise in the data repersentation </p>
<p>Curve smoothing uses interpolation technique: <b>estimating a value between two known values by using mathematical techniques.</b></p>
<p>In this curve smoothing we use <b>make_interp_spline</b> from scipy library.
<p>The interpolation method create a function with the data points (x,y).
<p>Make sure that the data <b>absicca 'x' </b>do not have any duplicates and is in increasing order.<p>
<p>The data <b>Ordinate 'y' </b>may have any duplicates.<p>
<p>Curve smoothing can be done many ways such as <b>by mean, by exponential</b> etc..</p>
